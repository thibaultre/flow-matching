# flow matching

This repository is an attempt at understanding (conditional) flow matching for generative modeling.

The following references are primarily used:

My research interests are:

- applying these techniques to offline goal conditioned reinforcement learning as was done in [this paper (May 2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19717).
- or to cognitive / robot control as was done in the ["Flow Model for General Robot Control"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24164) paper.
- development of efficient algorithms and approximations to enable real-time applications of similar models or techniques.
